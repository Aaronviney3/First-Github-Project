      <p>
        My name is Aaron, and I am currently in training to be a junior frontend
        software developer. I started frontend development through Frontend
        Simplified's online course. I am a very hard-working, self driven
        individual with a high drive to get things done in a timely manner. I
        have had an interest in programming for several years, first learning
        python, lua, and C++. Now with frontend development, I have much more
        drive to do something I feel is good for not only myself (being
        something I enjoy doing), but also for others. I have the power to make
        a massive change in the world, and on your team, you can expect a loyal
        and hard working employee with willingness to learn anything needed to
        perform my best for you. I am still very new to this, but if you give me
        a chance, I will not dissapoint you.
